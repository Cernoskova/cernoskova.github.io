    <h3>Our story and experience</h3>
    <p>
      Our team members have similar history â€“ for over ten years, we have been individually gaining experience in our fields (events
      management, communications, graphic design), both in industry and within scientific institutions and universities. From
      major international institutions, such as European Molecular Biology Laboratory and European Molecular Biology Organisation
      to national scientific organisations (Czech Academy of Sciences, Central European Institute of Technology, CEITEC). We
      were also involved in the development of European Research Infrastructures (ELIXIR, Instruct) and collaborated in many
      EU research projects (EXCELERATE, Era Chair, Twinning, CORBEL, and others). Over the years, we have organized more than
      450 events in different format, level and size, all with great success and great feedback. We are now bringing our expertise
      and experience to Longaro. Our main principles are transparency, individual approach to our clients, focus on details,
      knowledge of project requirements, flexibility, personal attitude and respect to the environment.
