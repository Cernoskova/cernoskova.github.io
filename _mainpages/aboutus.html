        <p> Our team members have similar history â€“ for over ten years, we have been individually gaining experience in
          our fields (events
          management, communications, graphic design), both in industry and within scientific institutions and
          universities. From
          major international institutions, such as European Molecular Biology Laboratory and European Molecular
          Biology Organisation
          to national scientific organisations (Czech Academy of Sciences, Central European Institute of Technology,
          CEITEC).</p>

    <p>We were also involved in the development of European Research Infrastructures (ELIXIR, Instruct) and
      collaborated in many
      EU research projects (EXCELERATE, Era Chair, Twinning, CORBEL, and others). Over the years, we have organized
      more than
      450 events in different format, level and size, all with great success and great feedback. We are now bringing
      our expertise
      and experience to Longaro. Our main principles are transparency, individual approach to our clients, focus on
      details,
      knowledge of project requirements, flexibility, personal attitude and respect to the environment.</p>
