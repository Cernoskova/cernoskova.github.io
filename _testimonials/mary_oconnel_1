testimony: "I have to thank you for all the help in organizing the three international conferences. I have done it in the past without assistance so I know how much work you put into it. I could not have done it without you. Always the delegates at the conference wanted to meet you as they were so grateful for the personalized attention you gave them. You really took care of every minute detail. You certainly helped raise the profile of CEITEC and make it a brand to be proud of."
